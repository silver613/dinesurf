My meal was spaghetti and meatballs, peppered snail and cocktail.\n\nThis restaurant has good structures, light and all particularly when you go at night but the workers are a turn off really. You are only allowed via reservations. Ensure you make your reservations a day or two before your outing.\n\nThe environment is small and only the highest of class are allowed to pack in. There was just this downgrade on some set of people that I didn't like. So if I am not driving the best of cars or buying the most expensive thing on the menu, I can't be treated right?\n\nThe waiter assigned to my table asked for a tip and also the workers at the gate. Everyone wanted a tip and that wasn't right. I did prefer I give without you having to ask me.\n\nAside from the workers, every other thing is nice. Customer service is poor. I eventually came down with a headache and requested ice, till I left, I didn't get it.\n\nThe places you can make reservations in are:\nPrive\nLounge\nTerrace\nRooftop (you can only take pictures there, it really isn't functional yet)\n\nLastly, beware of this particular American but Nigerian blood who works there. If you aren't high class or some proper big boy, he wouldn't attend to you\n\nMy order was snails and chips and some mango cocktail.",

The music is nice and there�s shisha for the smokers.\nThere�s a designated parking lot within and without the premises which is great. Although it�s located at a traffic prone spot.\nThe food of course is great. It can get a bit chilly at night outdoors so maybe take a pashmina if you can�t handle that.",

I however didn't like that the bouncer at the gate asked for a reservation (insinuating that it was full), when the restaurant was practically empty. My suspicion is that they profile guests, but i just didn't like the way that made me feel. On a bad day, we would have turned and walked away. It was funny that he started begging for \"his own\" when we were leaving after lunch.\n\nWe started with their platter and I thought that was quite good. I'd heard it's an expensive place, so was pleasantly surprised that the cost of the platter was fair and you you could actually eat just the platter. It was enough to serve 2 people. We didn't finish it so we could still eat the main dish.\n\nFor the main, I had jollof rice with croaker fish - a full croaker fish. The fish was tasty, however I thought the jollof lacked \"something\" - that thing that makes your eyes pop and your taste buds tingle at the taste of Nigerian jollof. It was edible but not memorable, atall. My friend had the burger and fries - she didn't complain or sing songs of praise, so I guess it was okay. We were quite full, so we didn't get dessert. Their strawberry margarita was yummy... I think it's their house special. Very very nice.\n\nThe service was good. Our server was quite personable and efficient; we didn't have to wait for our food. I liked that their sanitizer bottles were customized- little things that make a difference. The ambience was right and the toilet was clean. I'd happily recommend it.\n\nWithout the bouncer at the gate experience, it would easily have been 4 stars.",

But i just confess my favorite area is the rooftop, you get to see Lagos in its splendor, traffic, lights and the Ikoyi bridge and then the cool breeze from the water. Staff dressed veey well in uniforms and quite courteous. Menu is vast but very very pricey. Please be prepared to pay alot for a meal. I had the salmon, mashed potatoes and 2 bottles of red wine and paid over N60,000. That was very high for just one meal and 2 bottles of red wine. It would be a very lovely romantic spot for dinner but i won't advise for first date because it is pricey, you don't want to go home broke. It is a beautiful place to do a proposal.",

With sitting areas on the rooftop, water front and on two levels indoors, there's a place for just about everyone. The staff were friendly and the food came super quick, the ambience is also awesome regardless of where within the place you choose to spend your time. The food menu is a bit limited though so hopefully they'll add to it as time goes on.\n\nMy main reason for the four instead of five rating is the semi-compulsory valet service which honestly isn't necessary. The valet staff practically try to force you to allow them park your car themselves (obviously at a fee) even when you're perfectly capable of parking yourself. The alternative is parking in the dusty compound across the street even if there's ample parking space in front of the building - this to be honest is a big turn off and was enough reason for me to cancel my visit the first  time I tried visiting Circa.\n\nOtherwise it's a nice place.",

Circa Non Pareil is the next trendy hangout on the Lekki axis because people kept trooping in in groups and pairs. It also looks like there will some stores on the right side of the building.

It is an upscale place and the foods and drinks are expensive when compared with the GDP of Nigeria. However, the quantity of the foods were plenty :)\n\nOne major drawback is parking space. We were directed to a parking space opposite this location and it�s really stressful crossing the busy Admiralty Way. This becomes really disgusting knowing that there are empty car park lots in front of the building but deliberately left for commercial valet parking service that was never used during our stay here.
